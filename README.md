### Labelled Transition Systems for Agents’ Behaviour
In this work we aim to present a solution to the *Prison Puzzle* by using Labeled Transition Systems (**LTSs**) to model agents’ behavior. The problem consists in modeling,  using LTSs, a protocol that $N=3$ prisoners must agree upon in order to be freed from detention.

### Model Reduction for DTMCs

The project investigates the application of **strong lumpability** to a DTMC featuring five states, reducing it to a three-state model while preserving its essential probabilistic behavior.
